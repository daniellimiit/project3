    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Daniel Lim, I am a 3rd year majoring in ITM I originally started as a CS major, but have switched to ITM to explore different options in the technology field that may peak my interests more. I am 5'9" but subconcious of my height because many of my friends are well above 6' 3". I enjoy talking about food and its pretty ironic considering I am a mediocre chef at best and have had allergies growing up so I have a strong hatred for most foods that have had those ingredients.</p>

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Video Games</li>
      <li>Volleyball</li>
      <li>Food</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When it comes to my interests mine change very often, I usually just get sucked into anything that peaks my interests. As of the past 2 years I have got really sucked into these 3 topics since the Youtube Algortithim brought me down a rabbit hole when I initially looked into these at the beginning of quarantine.</p>
    <p>When it comes to video games, I grew up playing a lot of FPS, <em>Halo</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, etc. but lately my taste in gaming has shifted so I have been more attracted to more competitive games, the big one as of late has been <em>Solitare</em>. </p>
    <p>Volleyball has been pretty interesting topic, I grew up around all types of sports whether it be playing or watching, but no matter what I never really invested too much time because they never peaked my interests. Recently though I found myself stumbling across some U.S. national team in the olympics, as well as some videos on Youtube I just got sucked into it, especially watching the international scene and how intense the games get.</p>
    <p>I like food, food taste good and good food make me happy</p>
